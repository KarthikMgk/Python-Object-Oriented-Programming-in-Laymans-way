In this post, We discuss the topic of regular,class and static methods in python

This is easy, So lets start coding:


class employee:
    def __init__(self, fname, lname,age):
        self.fname = fname
        self.lname = lname
        self.age = age

    def fullname(self):                     #Here we declare regular functions which takes self as an object. 
        return self.fname + self.lname      #self represents the instance of the class (our instances are emp1,emp2 and whatever we declare)

    @classmethod                            #Keyword @classmethod denotes the following is a classmethod
    def from_lname(cls):                    #Note that we donot pass in self instead we pass cls(which representes our 'class employee')
        return cls.lname                    # wherever we used self in regular methods, we use cls(shortform of class since class is reserved)

    @staticmethod                           #Keyword @staticmethod denotes the following is a staticmethod
    def from_age(age):                      #Note that we neither pass 'cls' or 'self' as arguement coz its neither associated to a class or method
        return age>50                       #This is a standalone method, But can take the arguements of the class

emp1 = employee('john', 'wick',52)
emp2 = employee('justin', 'langer', 42)

print(emp1.fullname)
