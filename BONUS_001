In this blog, We will know the point of passing keyword 'object' in the class

EX:
class example(object):
    pass

The above line is the one which i'm going to clarify in this video...
What is the need of passing the keyword 'object'???

In Python 2.7, We had two types of styles of classes 

1. classic class
2. new style class

Python 2.7 would treat your class as a classic type if you didn't pass the 'object' keyword
And inorder to make use of the new style, usage of keyword 'object' was prescribed

But since the release of python3 its not required to pass in object since python3 for obvious reasons.

If you are using python3, you dont have to pass in the keyword object in your class
