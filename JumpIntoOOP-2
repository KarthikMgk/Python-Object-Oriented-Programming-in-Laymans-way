In this session, We are gonna look at class and instance variables in layman's terms

Getting back to our house example which we were talking in the first part of this series. In this part, We are gonna talk about two 
important concepts of OOP

1)Class Variables
2)Instance variable or Object variables (Instance and object are literally the same)

A Class variables is the door through which you would enter your house from outside

A Instance variable or an Object variable is the door through which you enter your own seperate room which inside your house

Consider your family consisits of 4 members and each have a seperate bed room, Everyone will enter the house through the same door(Class variable)
But after entering the house, 4 people would use 4 different rooms to enter the respective rooms(I'm being a bit explicit here)
If I open the door of my room, Its exclusive to my room and it doesnt allow me to enter other person's room

POINTS TO REMEBER:

1. Class variable is the main entry door of your home and are declared outside any function
2. Instance variable is the entry door for your own seperate room which inside your house and are declared inside the function
3. Your door leads only to your room

Lets Code:

class employee():
    raise_amt = 1.05                                 #The class variable which is declared outside any function
    def __init__(self, fname, lname,pay):
        self.fname = fname                
        self.lname = lname
        self.pay = pay

    def perc_inc(self):
        self.pay = int(self.pay * self.raise_amt)     #If you notice, We are using the class variable inside the function as 'self.raise_amt'

emp1 = employee('Jon', 'venus', 50)
emp2 = employee('rick', 'johnson', 55)

print(emp1.pay)                                     # prints pay before increase
emp1.perc_inc()                                     # increases the pay for the employee and stores it in pay attribute of the emp1 function
print(emp1.pay)                                     # prints the pay


Different implentations:

1) employee.raise_amt = 1.07
   print(employee.raise_amt)
   print(emp1.raise_amyt)

ANS: Upon using the above mentioned variation of class variable declaration, We are setting the class variable to 1.07
which in turn sets all the attributes of the instances to 1.07. In simple terms, Its we set raise_amt = 1.07 globally


2) emp1.raise_amt = 1.08
   print(emp1.raise_amt)
   print(employee.raise_amt)
ANS: This implementation sets the value of raise_amt attribute of the emp1 Instance to 1.08 and the Employee.raise_amt to be in its 
original value of 1.07
